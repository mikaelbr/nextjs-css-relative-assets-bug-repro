## Bug with locally referred assets from CSS

Referring to npm package with local assets with relative path resolution fails in newer Next.js versions. [See issue #33781](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/33781).

## Working Locally (dev server)

![Working example with dev server](./dev-working.png)

## Not working production

```
yarn build
yarn next start -p 4000
open http://localhost:4000
```

This is the URL generated by Webpack config:

![URL trying to be resolved](./url.png)

But should be something like `/_next/static/media/3A95AC_3_0.9adbdede.woff2`
